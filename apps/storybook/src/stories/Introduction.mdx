## Introduction

In this project, we’re using Storybook.js to create a visual, interactive library of components.
Each story showcases a single component’s functionality, state, and potential use cases, making development more efficient and collaborative.
Storybook enables developers, designers, and testers to view and play with each component in isolation, ensuring they’re robust and ready for production.

That makes it easy to develop hard-to-reach states. Save these UI states as **stories** to revisit during development, testing, or QA.

Explore our components, understand their variations, and feel free to contribute to the ever-growing library.

Browse example stories now by navigating to them in the sidebar.
View their code in the `stories` directory to learn how they work.
We recommend building UIs with a [**component-driven**](https://componentdriven.org) process starting with atomic components and ending with pages.

## Layout

The layout of the Storybook is divided into three main sections:

1. **Styling & Theming** - This section contains out styling and theming guide with our color palette and typography.
1. **UI** - This section contains all the general components that are available in the design system
1. **Forms** - This section contains all the form components that are available in the design system
